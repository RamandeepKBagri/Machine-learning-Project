# Machine-learning-project
Machine learning project using Python 
It is done for class project "Introduction to machine learning and data minning"
- Dataset used: Electricity from UCI datasets
- First part of the project is done without PCA used different classifiers: 
 --- Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN Classifier, Random forest, Decision Tree algorithiums 
 --- Cross checked results using confiusion matrix with only limited number of samples.
- Second part of the project is done with PCA used different classifiers: 
 --- Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN Classifier, Random forest, Decision Tree algorithiums 
 --- Cross checked results using confiusion matrix with only limited number of samples.
